A simple library to send SMS messages through the Clickatell gateway (clickatell.com). This library handles some of the basic operations like sending messages, checking the status of a message, checking your account balance, etc.

It is geared toward sending one message to a bunch of different phone numbers. If the message has more than 50 recipients, it will break it up into multiple messages (as required by Clickatell)

This library was was extracted from, and is currently used in 2 of my businesses, School's Out (schoolsout.com), and CampusWire (thecampuswire.com). 

Example usage

require 'clickatell'
client = Clickatell.new do |client|
  client.username = MY_USERNAME
  client.password = MY_PASSWORD
  client.app_id   = APP_ID
end

result = client.send("test message", %w(2105551000 2104440000))
=> [{:claimcheck=>"90fd3391a40f35e281b3e2506e5502b6e", :time=>Thu Jun 26 16:36:22 -0500 2008, :message=>"test message", :phonenumber=>"2105551000"}, {:claimcheck=>"88d5df89ce3c21f7417755aec59c0ea23", :time=>Thu Jun 26 16:36:22 -0500 2008, :message=>"test message", :phonenumber=>"2104440000"}]


# Check the status of a message by claimcheck
client.get_status "0fd3391a40f35e281b3e2506e5502b6e"
=> "Received by recipient"

# See how many credits you have left
client.credit_balance
=> 21920


Note: Since normal SMS messages don't support Unicode characters, this library (crudely) strips out any character whose integer value is >255.
